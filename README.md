## Usage
**THIS PROJECT REQUIRES NODE.JS!** https://nodejs.org
1. Use Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to create a table of your data; x in the first column, y in the second. Do not place labels.
2. Export your spreadsheet as a CSV file with the name `data.csv`.
3. Place the file in the root of the project.
4. Run the project using `node .` in the working directory.

## Features
 * Takes data and fits a linear equation from it
 * Calculates the average deviation of values from the fitted line and finds a range of probable points from calculated high and low bound equations
 * Plots all equations and data on Desmos
